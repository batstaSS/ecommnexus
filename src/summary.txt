I was assigned to make a PLP's page. 

I tried to keep things simple in creating the files to make the project a little more understandable and readable.
For the data I created a separete file called "data.js" where I created an array of products.  


1. The navigation bar is fully HTML and CSS designed and every container is inside a div.
I also decided to add a search bar, despite it not being in the requirements to complete the project. Hope that's okay. The search bar is the only dynamic component in the navbar.

2. Footer - again, HTML and CSS, and couple of links to an external website.

3. Sidebar
    - created different components then combined them together in the Sidebar.js file
    - to make everything in the sidebar dynamic I created a file called Input.js where I used props and assigned them to html tags.
    - i used these props in all the files in Sidebar folder. 
    - for the files I used HTML and CSS
4. Card.js - thats the file where i created the grid - HTML and CSS
5. App.js - thats where I implemented almost all of my React logic - created a couple of useState and const variables that implement those useStates, 
the filter keyword to loop through the array and to exclude/include products based on a condition and the map keyword to run a function on the array and return a new result. 


What i found hard during coding:
    - styling the grid.
    - creating a sort, load more and cart functions -> thats why there is none here, i had a lot of bugs and couldnt figure out a solution to them. 
    - i couldnt make the footer stay at the bottom despite the shown products. 

I started the project 4 days ago, and uploaded it to github all at once now.
